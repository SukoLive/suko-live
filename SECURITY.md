## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you think you have discovered a vulnerability, please report it at [support at suko dot live](mailto:support@suko.live).

If confirmed upon investigation, we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the reporter.
